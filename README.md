# Ada Forcasting and Trading Bot

This project came from a discussion about Cardano’s native cryptocurrency ADA. As Cardano's network prepares for smart contract functionality, we wanted to see how different machine learning models could perform regarding price prediction leading up to this historic event.


Team members:
* Abrar Aman  
* TC Revelle
* Anthony Tilotta

Project Outline:
Compare two or more machine learning models for solving a predictive task.
Task
- Trading bot based off of historical Ada data

Research questions:
- Ada’s price performance pre and post smart contract deployment (sept 12th)

Data sets and Methods to use:

- Training / tests X, y 
- Scaling
- Random forest classifiers 
- Easy ensemble classifiers
- create a simple dashboard UI

Rough breakdown in tasks:
- Anthony = get ADA historical data, trading bot 
- Abrar = Machine Learning methods, trading bot
- TC = Dashboard portion, trading bot
